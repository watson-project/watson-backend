Keeping the style of open source, every article is able to be viewed, edited, and deleted by any user.

The Watson.
Share the Future.

## What we did for the Backend

The backend developers for The Watson created a dynamic model that allows users to post an image url, title, author and the content. We structured the controller to allow users to update, create and delete. We also arranged tests utilizing Node.js to compare the data and figure out whether our API is functional. This API helped create The Watson to forsee the future.

Update (1/28/2021): 
The backend developers did an amazing job adding 'User Authorization.'
